There's a lot to talk about when it comes to accessibility. But it doesn't have to take a long time. One minute short segments is all it takes. And that's what I'm doing with this Tik Tok series.

### More Information

I've been "doing accessibility" for a while now. I teach and consult on that topic with small and large companies - whether they  are large listed multinationals, tertiary education providers, non-profits, or other organizations. They have two problems in common: First, they don't really know about accessibility. Then, they don't have a lot of time to learn about it. Chances are it'll be the same for you if you are a designer, a developer, a quality assurance tester, a program manager, a product owner. 

So I hope this series will help you build your understanding, and confidence, about digital accessibility
