-   After a long time, I am writing this blog as I had an hectic
    semester (Semester 6) with acads, Spider R&D, BMS (Battery
    Management Systems) project and participating in
    [TOP-IMSD\'24](https://sksaha.com/content/topimsd) (Will write one
    about [this](https://github.com/RaMathuZen/top-imsd-24) in future!)
    (Ah Placement Exams too :\|).

-   Then I had went for an Internship to a company as a Hardware
    Research Intern but I was told to automate some testing instruments
    like DSO, Load Analyzer, Logic Analyzer etc.

-   Finally after all these I entered into my final year and having some
    peace i.e time to work on some other exciting projects and improve
    myself!. So I\'m planning to be a little regular in blogging which
    implies that I do will spend some time exploring new.

# Notes from KLUG session

-   Today I attended the Kanchipuram Linux Users Group\'s (KLUG) Weekly
    Meet for a while and I got to know about,
    -   **dotenvx** and **sujo**

## [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/)

-   To manage env, config management for whatever software, programs you
    develop in whichever language and also solving all problems
    previously was with dotenv !

## soju

-   It is a [IRC Bouncer](https://soju.im/) that can be used for logging
    data from IRC channels. Need to explore on how to use and configure
    it.

-   Also got to know about how to generate PDFs of websites using
    headless chromium.
