### Transcript

Welcome to Nic’s accessibility minute

You  may  wonder what digital accessibility and blueberry muffins have in common. Let me tell you.

I was reviewing a design yesterday for accessibility. I was able to point out several issues to the designers. They said that they've been working on that for weeks. And then they said that they really should have asked me to review their design at the very early stages. 

Well... That's like blueberry muffins!

If you bake blueberry muffins but you try to put the blueberries in after the muffin is baked, it's going to make a big mess. It's going to take time. It's going to be costly.

You really want to start thinking about accessibility from the early stages of design. And then at every step after that. 

So that's where blueberry muffins and digital accessibility are similar!

There you go!
