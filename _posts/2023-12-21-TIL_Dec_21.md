## Reproducability

- From this [blog](http://developmentalsystems.org/how_many_random_seeds), I got aware of this **reproducibility issue** in RL i.e execution of same alogrithm in same enironment gives different results each time. It might be due different initial conditions, seeds etc for e.g. issues faced when [reproducing a deep RL paper](http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl) by Matthew Rahtz.

- For which the author proposes some *statistical tests* and he has a written a paper about [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08295).

May be I have to have a look on it later.

- ACL has been already implemented by these [guys](https://github.com/flowersteam/TeachMyAgent).

## micro-ROS

Today I did a hello world in micro-ROS. micro-ROS is used for interfacing ROS with resource constrained embedded devices. I had bought an ESP32-WROOM board since micro-ROS supports ESP, I thought of trying it and followed this [post](https://robofoundry.medium.com/esp32-micro-ros-actually-working-over-wifi-and-udp-transport-519a8ad52f65). In which I did,

   - I had compiled the int32_publisher example using `idf.py`(provided by ESP) and flashed it to my ESP board.

   - Then ran a micro-ROS agent(docker container) on my laptop and which recieved messages from ESP.

Basically we have to write a C code using ESP,micro-ROS and RTOS(FreeRTOS) libraries which then can be compiled & flashed into ESP and then it works accordingly. I had this [issue](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_espidf_component/issues/217) with specifying the port for the agent.

Have to go through the `rclc` [API](https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/programming_rcl_rclc/node/).

I am gonna work on some project like with FreeRTOS & micro-ROS ?
