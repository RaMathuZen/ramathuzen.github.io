# GDB க்கான பீஜின் விரைவான வழிகாட்டி (Beej's Quick Guide to GDB)

I've translated the Beej's Guide on GDB to tamil. It is based on this project idea put forth by [Thanga Ayyanar aka Gold Ayan](https://goldayan.in/) in [Kaniyam Foundation's Project Ideas](https://github.com/KaniyamFoundation/ProjectIdeas/issues/218). Initially I planned to do it as a part of Hacktoberfest but It took time and in the meanwhile I also got busy with other works. Finally the [translation](https://github.com/RaMathuZen/gdb_beej_tamil/blob/main/gdb_ta.md) is 
out. If you found any mistakes you can raise a issue in the repo where it has been hosted. [shrini](https://goinggnu.wordpress.com/) said after some review it will be made as a series of few posts in [Kaniyam website](https://kaniyam.com/). 

This is my First Open Source Contribution, so I feel happy that I've started to give back something to FOSS, Tamil community. It was also discussed by Thanga Ayyanar in [Nov 3 - Kanchi LUG Weekly News](https://youtu.be/lfDbFbnj9BM?t=480). Hoping to contribute more in future!
