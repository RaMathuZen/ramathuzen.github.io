Welcome to Nic’s accessibility minute

Yes, blind people use computers. It may seem obvious to some of us, but not for everyone. In fact, the chief technical officer of a fairly large company was very surprised a few years ago when I told her about this. 

So, it's not just blind folkss. It's also people with a variety of disabilities. Whether there's no control of arms, or speech, or eyes, or any other number of conditions. 

We must make sure that everything we build works for disabled people. That's nearly 1 in 4 users who have a potential disability.

So, yeah. Blind people use computers. Disabled people use computers. We spend money.

We really want to make stuff that works for everyone.

So there you go!
