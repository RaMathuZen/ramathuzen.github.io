# Tools I Have 

This is a blog post that will reside in my bookmarks to remind me about some tools that I can use.

## LLMs

- **llm** - a CLI tool to  interact with ChatGPT

- **bard-cli** - a CLI tool to interact with Bard

## Coding

- symbex - to search for specific *classes* and *functions* in all python source files present in a directory and can also be used to pipe to llm inorder to explain it.
