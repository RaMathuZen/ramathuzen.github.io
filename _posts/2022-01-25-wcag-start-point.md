### Transcript

Welcome to Nic's accessibility minute.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, sometimes referred to as Way-cag or WCAG. They are great. But they are the starting point. They're not the target of accessibility. 

There's so much more that we can do around accessibility. Obviously we want to start with the accessibility guidelines because they inform us of some very basic and important stuff to do to make our websites and apps accessible. 

But it doesn't contain everything. And we can go beyond. We can look at best practices. We can go at always building better things.

We can't just rest on "oh well, we're WCAG conformant" and that's it, there's nothing else we can do.

Do more. Always!

So there you go!
