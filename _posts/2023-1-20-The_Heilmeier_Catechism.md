# The Heilmeir Catechism

- George H. Heilmeier, a former DARPA director (1975-1977), crafted a set of questions known as the **Heilmeier Catechism** 
to help Agency officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs.

> ### The 8 Questions

    1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
    
    2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
    
    3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
    
    4. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
    
    5. What are the risks?
    
    6. How much will it cost?
    
    7. How long will it take?
    
    8. What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?

These are some relevant questions that can be asked within ourselves and also answered  when expressing to others while 
making a proposal/project.
