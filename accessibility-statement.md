## Introduction

I'm committed to accessibility. This website should work for everyone. Simple as that. 

This statement includes a description of my current, and future efforts in accessibility, contact information, and current conformance status, and known issues and workarounds for those issues.

## Contact Information
If you need assistance with this site, the best way to reach me are either via [email](https://mailto:nic@incl.ca) or via [twitter](https://twitter.com/vavroom).


## Accessibility Background
I've been working in the field of web accessibility since 1995. I'm an expert accessibility consultant who provides [accessibility training](https://incl.ca/speaker/), consults with small and large companies. This site, apart from the exceptions listed below, should be working just fine and conform to WCAG 2.1 AA (as of January 2022)

## Current Conformance Status
The site was developped in January 2022 to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA. All areas of the site conform with this accessibility standard.

### Exception
* All embeded feature of the Tik Tok videos, including:
	* Lack of visible focus
	* Button labels
	* Opening links in new windows without warning
	* iframe without title
	
### Workaround
The content of the video can be accessed through the Transcript section on each page. While this is far from ideal, it is currently the only option until Tik Tok (who has been contacted about these issues) remediates them.

## Feedback
I welcome your feedback on the accessibility of this site. Please let me know if you encounter accessibility barriers on this site.
